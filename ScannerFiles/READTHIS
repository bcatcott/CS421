Use scanner.cpp to write your scanner so that it will
move smoothly onto the parser.

In scannertest2, the 2nd column are words causing lexical errors.
 
Check your outputs against correctoutput1 and correctoutput2 

Do NOT read from the files lexicon.txt and reservedword.text.
Just use them as references.
